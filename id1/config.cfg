// This file contains settings that will be applied every time Quake runs.
// However, this file will be overwritten when/if you use the in-game menus
// to change settings.

// For sanity we're going to start with a default sv_aim of 1 because this
// should be desirable for anyone using mouselook. This setting disables the
// mild "vertical autoaim" effect that Quake has by default (to help
// keyboard-only players). In Mark V you can control this value through the
// "Server Aim" setting in the Preferences menu.

sv_aim "1"

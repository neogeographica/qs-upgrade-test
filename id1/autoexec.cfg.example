// This file is an EXAMPLE of the settings you could put in your autoexec.cfg
// file. To use settings in this file, either copy them into your autoexec.cfg
// file (if you already have one) or else just rename this whole file to
// autoexec.cfg.

// Any line that starts with doubleslash is a comment and has no effect.

// For more discussion, see autoexec-cfg-example-annotated.txt. Detailed
// comments have been moved to that file because of Quake limits on config
// file size.


// about the settings in this file
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

// The comment lines in the sections below describe a setting and then provide
// an example of that setting. The example setting is currently commented out
// with a doubleslash just so it won't immediately take effect if you rename
// this file to autoexec.cfg.

// If you want a setting to take effect in your autoexec.cfg, make sure to
// remove the doubleslash from the beginning of the line. You can change the
// setting's value if you like... you don't have to use the example value
// shown below.

// Some of these values correspond to settings that are also exposed through
// menus in some modern Quake engines. If you set them in the autoexec.cfg
// file instead of through the menus, then the value in autoexec.cfg will be
// applied whenever Quake starts, regardless of what you set in the menus.



// Set host_maxfps to a higher value to raise the framerate cap, or set it to
// 0 for uncapped framerate. Note that this is not advised in Mark V or the
// original Quakespasm as physics issues will pop up at framerates over 72.
// For Quakespasm-Spiked and several other Quake engines this is OK though.

//   Default depends on the Quake engine but is usually 72. Uncomment the
//   following line to set some other value.
//host_maxfps 144


// Set sv_aim to a value of 1 or more for no autoaim, or a value less than 1
// for some vertical autoaim.

//   Default is 0.93. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//sv_aim 1


// Set crosshair to 1 to enable the crosshair and 0 to disable it.

//   Default is 0. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//crosshair 1


// Set a scr_crosshairscale value from 1 to 10 to control the size of the
// crosshair, including decimal values like 3.5.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//scr_crosshairscale 2


// Set gl_texturemode for amount of texture filtering and "pixely-ness".
// There are several values for this, but a few interesting ones are:
//   GL_NEAREST for pixely textures and no mipmaps (so, loss of quality on
//   far objects)
//   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST for pixely textures and abrupt mipmap level
//   transitions as the textured object gets farther away.
//   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR for pixely textures but smooth transitions
//   between mipmap levels.
//   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR for smoothed textures and smooth transitions
//   between mipmap levels.

//   Default is GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR. Uncomment the following line to set
//   some other value.
//gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR


// Increase gl_texture_anisotropy for more texture clarity in some situations.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//gl_texture_anisotropy 8


// Set r_viewmodel_quake to a value of 1 to make the position of the held
// weapon's model be more like it is in WinQuake.

//   Default is 0. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//r_viewmodel_quake 1


// Set r_particles to 2 for square particles, 1 for round.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//r_particles 2


// Set r_wateralpha to 1 for no liquids transparency, 0 for full liquids
// transparency, or some decimal value in between. Note that the map itself
// may force some other value.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//r_wateralpha 0.5


// Set these variables to determine other material transparencies. 0 means
// to use whatever the r_wateralpha value is. Otherwise, values up to 1 will
// set the amount of transparency with 1 being fully opaque.

//   Default is 0. Uncomment the following line(s) to set some other value.
//r_lavaalpha 0.5
//r_slimealpha 0.5
//r_telealpha 0.5


// Set r_lerpmove to 0 for old jerky enemy animations, 1 for smoothed.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//r_lerpmove 0


// Set r_lerpmodels to 0 for old jerky weapon animations, 1 for smoothed.

//   Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.
//r_lerpmodels 0

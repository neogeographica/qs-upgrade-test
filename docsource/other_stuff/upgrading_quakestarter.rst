Upgrading Quakestarter
======================

From 2.x
--------

If you already have a Quake installation that contains a 2.x version of Quakestarter, and you want to replace the 2.x Quakestarter with a newer 3.x version, you can just overwrite the existing files with the new files. You should probably check the :doc:`Changelog<changelog>` in the new documentation to see what has changed, in case there's some new thing you want to take advantage of.

Note that the first time you run Quakestarter after a 2.x-to-3.x upgrade, it will remove the old 2.x documentation.

That's it!


From 1.x
--------

However if your Quake installation contains a 1.x version of Quakestarter, and you want to replace the 1.x Quakestarter with a 2.x or 3.x version, you'll need to address some things. Please see the `1.x to 2.x upgrade instructions`_ archived on GitHub. (These will also apply to any 1.x-to-3.x upgrades.)

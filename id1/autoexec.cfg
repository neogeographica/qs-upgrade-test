// This file contains settings that will be applied every time Quake runs.
// Any line that starts with doubleslash is a comment and has no effect.

// Some of the commented lines below are example settings (in these examples,
// they are terms that start with "gl_" or "r_"). You can delete the doubleslash
// on that line, and edit the setting's value if you like, and that setting
// will then take effect the next time you start Quake.

// You can also just add any other settings you like into this file. If
// you want to get deep into Quake config file editing though, you should
// read up about the difference between autoexec.cfg and config.cfg.


// Below are some example settings you may want to fiddle with to achieve
// a more 1996-ish look.


// some texture settings -- only matters for the GLQuake renderer
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

// Set gl_texturemode for amount of texture filtering and "pixely-ness".
// There are several values for this, but a couple of interesting ones
// are:
//   GL_NEAREST for pixely textures and abrupt mipmap level transitions.
//   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR for pixely textures but smooth transitions
//   between mipmap levels.
//   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR for smoothed textures and smooth transitions
//   between mipmap levels.
// Default is GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR. Uncomment the following line to set
// some other value.

//gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR

// Increase gl_texture_anisotropy for more clarity with pixel-y textures
// Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.

//gl_texture_anisotropy 8

// Set r_particles to 2 for square particles, 1 for round.
// Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.

//r_particles 2


// some transparency & mirror-surface settings
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

// Original Quake didn't have transparent liquids or mirrors. If you prefer
// that, you can set all of these values to 1. Lower values are more
// transparent (or mirror-y). Note that if you are NOT using Mark V,
// then r_wateralpha applies to all liquids and the other variables don't
// do anything.
// Defaults are 1, 0.2, 0.7, and 0.5 respectively. Uncomment the following
// lines to set some other value.

//r_lavaalpha 1
//r_mirroralpha 1
//r_slimealpha 1
//r_wateralpha 1


// some animation settings
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

// Note that the two values below are also exposed in the Mark V menus,
// as the "Effects" setting in the "Preferences" menu. Setting "Effects" to
// "Normal + Jerky" will set both of these values to zero.

// If you set the values in this autoexec.cfg file instead of through the
// menus, then the values here will be applied whenever Quake starts,
// regardless of what you previously set in the menus.

// Set r_lerpmove to 0 for old jerky enemy animations, 1 for smoothed.
// Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.

//r_lerpmove 0

// Set r_lerpmodels to 0 for old jerky weapon animations, 1 for smoothed.
// Default is 1. Uncomment the following line to set some other value.

//r_lerpmodels 0

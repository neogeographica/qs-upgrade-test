**** Quake Injector

Quake Injector (https://www.quaddicted.com/tools/quake_injector) is worth a look when you're ready to really dig into Quake addons. It has a bit of a learning curve, but it runs on any OS (as a Java app) and it understands how to install and launch every bit of content from Quaddicted.

Two things to look out for:

* If a mod has had a separate patch released for it, Quake Injector won't automatically install the patch for you... you'll need to read the mod description and download the mod patch yourself. This rarely comes up though.

* The Mark V install feature (and therefore these batch scripts that use it) doesn't work exactly the same as Quake Injector. They each have their own folder where they store downloaded zipfiles, and they may have different ideas about what to name a mod's folder. (For example Mark V will install Arcane Dimensions 1.5 in the "ad_v1_50final" folder, while Quake Injector will store it in the "ad" folder.) So to avoid wasting disk space on duplicate stuff, it's best to settle on using only one of these install methods.


**** DIY

Once you're familiar with how Quake maps and mods work, it's not rocket science to install them yourself. The main things to be aware of are:

The best place to find singleplayer Quake content is at https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/

You can also watch for new releases at http://www.celephais.net/board/forum.php

When you download an addon, it sometimes consists of a bunch of files that are meant to be placed inside a new game folder in your Quake installation. If this is the case then there should be a readme file included that tells you this. (Usually it's obvious anyway.)

If it is just a map that doesn't change anything else about Quake gameplay, it can instead be placed into your "id1\maps" folder (which you can create if necessary). This is the case if the addon just consists of a .bsp file and maybe an associated .txt file.

**** Mark V install

The Mark V Quake engine supports an "install" command in the Quake console that will automatically download and install content. This is pretty neat, but as of December 2016, there are still some pieces of content that Mark V does not install correctly. So I won't go into a lot of details about the "install" command in this readme. The installer batch files in this package do make use of that command though.

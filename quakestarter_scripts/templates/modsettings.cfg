// This script will be executed by quake.rc when the mod is launched.

// This file was initially generated containing the recommended settings (if
// any) that came with the mod, either from a config file or the readme. Some
// or all of those may not be necessary for the Quake engine that you are
// using, but generally they should be harmless. You can edit this file as
// you like, to change/remove those settings or add new mod-specific settings.

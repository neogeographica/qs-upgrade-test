Hi, 

This should be all the latest files and updates of Nehahra in one ready-to-go
package. The former mess of files was just too confusing. :o)
Expecting most people nowadays do not have the Seal of Nehahra movie installed
I unpacked the pak0.pak. If you have the movie installed please make
sure not to overwrite its pak0.pak with the one included in this zip!

I made all filenames lowercase for case-sensitive operating systems.
I made nehahra/ to be the folder right in the zip instead of QUAKE/
The latest version of aguirRe's Nehahra engine was included, it is recommended
for playing (glquake.exe, Version 3.08 Aug 2007). The readme for it is
nehahra/readmeneh.txt
You can find the latest version at http://user.tninet.se/~xir870k/

Enjoy!

**** What is that?

A program that plays Quake is often called a "Quake engine" or a "source port". Community members have been working on such things since soon after the original Quake source code was released back in the 90s.

The following Steam guide has an overview of several Quake engines, although I've let it become outdated: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118401000

Different Quake engines have different goals. Some are focussed on singleplayer, some on multiplayer; some are mostly about fixing bugs or adding "quality of life" features, while others are about supporting new visual effects; etc.

Currently Quakespasm is a sort of "reference standard" for playing new singleplayer map releases. Variants like Quakespasm-Spiked or vkQuake (or "cousins" like Mark V) add features on top of the Quakespasm baseline without drastically changing its play experience or its compatibility/stability.


**** Why Quakespasm-Spiked?

For this package I've chosen to include only the Quakespasm-Spiked engine, from https://fte.triptohell.info/moodles/qss/

Quakespasm-Spiked essentially matches Quakespasm for compatibility, and it adds important usability improvements that can smooth out the experience of playing or managing many existing addons... like supporting higher framerates and the ability to load multiple mod folders. It also implements features like advanced particle systems and customizable HUD/menus that newer addons can take advantage of. Arcane Dimensions is one example of a recent mod that can make use of these QSS features.

Performance-hungry users with recent graphics cards may be interested in trying out vkQuake, from https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake . This is a version of Quakespasm with a Vulkan renderer. It doesn't (yet?) support the fancier features of Quakespasm-Spiked, but does support a lot of the important stuff like high framerates and multi-mod-folder.

Previous versions of Quakestarter bundled Mark V instead, and Mark V does still have several advantages especially in its in-game menus. But while Quakespasm-Spiked has increased its compatibility/stability and its adoption among singleplayer users, Mark V has stagnated and now cannot play (or at least play well) some recent releases.

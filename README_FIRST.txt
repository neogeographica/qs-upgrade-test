This package is one way to get started with the 2016 "state of the art" in Quake singleplayer. It's meant to be a convenient bundle of useful tools and explanations. The tools included in here are:

- The Simple Quake Launcher by "MaxEd", from https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplequakelauncher/ .

- The Mark V "Quake engine" (Quake-playing program) by "Baker", from http://quakeone.com/markv/ . The Mark V website has additional info about the engine, more credits for other contributors, and links to other stuff you might want to download. Also note that there are several other Quake engines out there; see the "quake_engines.txt" file in the "readmes\other_stuff" folder if you're curious.

- Batch files to download and install a few of the many custom singleplayer addons for Quake.


You might want to keep an eye out in the future for a newer release of Mark V. You can just drop new Mark V files in here and replace the older versions.


So what do you do now? The quick version is:

- Move or copy your "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak" files (Quake game data) into the "id1" folder.

- Run the "install_music" batch file (in the "installers" folder) to install the soundtrack.

- Run other installers if you want to grab some selected custom content. The "install_2016_episodes" batch file is a good way to get started with some recent stuff.

- Run Quake, using "mark_v.exe" (acts like GLQuake) or "mark_v_winquake.exe" (acts like WinQuake). If you want to play custom content, it's easier if you use "SQLauncher.exe", the Simple Quake Launcher (which requires .Net 3.5 to be installed).

- Use the Mark V menus and/or config files to configure Quake the way you like it.


If you're a Quake veteran that's probably all you need to know.

If those steps aren't clear, or if you just want more details, have a look at the files in the "readmes\basic" folder for explanations.

When you want even more things to play, check out the files in the "readmes\maps_and_mods" folder.

The tools included in this package are for Windows users, but much of the info will also apply to playing Quake on macOS or Linux. See the "readmes\other_stuff\not_windows.txt" file for some specific pointers.

The other files in the "readmes\other_stuff" folder are a little more specialized and you might not need to bother with them. You'll see that they're referenced from other readmes in a few spots, or you can just have a look at them if you're curious.

Have fun!

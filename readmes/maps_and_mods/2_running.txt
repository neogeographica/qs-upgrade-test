This file is strictly about considerations when using Simple Quake Launcher 2 (or a similar launcher).

If you're using the installer as your launcher, then all of this stuff is taken care of for you. The installer will also show you the Quake command line it is using for the launch, so you can get a feel of how these settings work. Simple Quake Launcher 2 isn't as automatic, but it will come in handy when you try out other addons beyond the ones covered by the installer.


**** Game

Most addons just use "Quake" for the "Game" setting, but in some cases an included readme file may tell you differently.

A readme that mentions the "-hipnotic" command-line argument is an indicator that you should specify "MP1: Scourge of Armagon" as the "Game" in the launcher. A mention of "-rogue" is an indicator to specify "MP2: Dissolution of Eternity" as the "Game".

Some addons may ask that you use missionpack 1 even if you don't have that missionpack installed. In that case, the mod doesn't use any assets from the missionpack, but it does use some missionpack-specific code inside your Quake engine.

Some addons require using the mod Quoth as the base game. If you don't have Quoth you can get it from https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/quoth/ and install it into a game folder named "quoth".

Quoth is the "Game" to specify if a readme mentions using the "-quoth" command-line argument or generally talks about having a Quoth requirement. Even if the readme mentions both "-quoth" and "-hipnotic", then specifying just "Quoth" as the "Game" in the launcher is still the thing to do.

For the maps and episodes covered by this installer, FYI these are the ones that have special base game requirements:

- apsp2, apsp3, e1m5quotha, func_mapjam9_2, red777, and warpspasm require specifying "Quoth" as the "Game". Installing these using the "installer" batch file will also get and install Quoth for you if necessary, and tell you that Quoth is required when playing that content.

- gotshun-never-released_levels requires specifying "MP1: Scourge of Armagon" as the "Game". That missionpack must also currently be installed.

- chapters requires specifying "MP1: Scourge of Armagon" as the "Game". This is true even if you do not have that missionpack currently installed!

- nehahra requires specifying "Nehahra" as the "Game".


**** Mod

If the content is in its own game folder -- which will always be the case for content installed through these batch files! -- then use Simple Quake Launcher 2 to select that game folder as the "Mod" to launch. 

Otherwise select the "[Default]" mod.


**** Other requirements

Check the addon's readme file to see if there are any special requirements for running it, or anything that you should know about new weapons or monsters.

Note that any of the content downloaded through the installer batch files in this package should be good to go with Mark V, without any additional work from you.

However if you're playing content that was installed in some other way, and you're wondering what to do with any mod-recommended settings, see the "readmes\other_stuff\mod_requirements.txt" file.


**** Launching

Once you have the "Game" and "Mod" set, pick the map and skill setting you want to play, and launch.

For custom episodes, Simple Quake Launcher 2 will often figure out the first map of the episode and select it by default. You can also check any included readme file to see what the first map should be.

Some addons do not have a startmap or hub map, and are just a collection of individual maps. In that case you'll need to select and launch each map individually to play it.

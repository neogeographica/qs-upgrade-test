**** Game data

First you need two game data files from Quake: "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak". Put these files inside the "id1" folder, and you're ready to play Quake. If you don't have these files handy and you don't know how to get them, see "readmes\other_stuff\pak_files.txt".

Similarly, if you own and want to play the official Quake missionpacks, each of those also has its own "pak0.pak" file that goes into its own unique game folder (next to the "id1" folder): "hipnotic" for missionpack 1, or "rogue" for missionpack 2.


**** Simple Quake Launcher

Once you have these pak files in place, the easiest way to play is often by using the Simple Quake Launcher, "SQLauncher.exe". This program has a requirement for Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5. If you don't have .Net 3.5 installed, Windows may ask to install it the first time you run the Simple Quake Launcher; otherwise you'll need to get it from http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=25150


**** DirectX 9 Runtime

Mark V, the Quake engine included in this package, has a few variants that cover different rendering styles and graphics APIs. Some of these variants are described in the "2_running.txt" readme. FYI if you want to use the dx9_mark_v.exe variant, you will need an up-to-date version of the DirectX 9 runtime package installed. If you play other games on this system then you may already have this installed. If not though, you can get it from https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=35


**** Soundtrack

Mark V (and several other Quake engines) can play the soundtrack from mp3 files if the physical Quake CD is not in your CD drive. To get these files installed, assuming you're on Windows, go into the "installers" folder and double click on the "install_music" batch file. This will give you the option to install soundtrack mp3 files for the original Quake campaign, and also for the official missionpacks if you have those.

FYI the "install_music" batch file (and the other installer batch files) will run the Mark V engine in order to perform a download; you can follow the download progress bar at the top of the Mark V console window. Once a download is finished and files extracted then the Mark V window will close.


**** Additional singleplayer content

The "installers" folder has other batch files that can be used to download some of the many community-created singleplayer adventures. These batch files, and ways to find all the rest of the available Quake singleplayer content, are discussed in the maps_and_mods readmes.

For starters you might want to download two new episodes released in 2016: "Dimension of the Past" and "Arcane Dimensions 1.5". You can use the "install_2016_episodes" batch file to download and install either or both of these.

"Dimension of the Past" is the "fifth Quake episode" created by J.F. Gustafsson and released by Machine Games in honor of Quake's 20th anniversary. It's a polished release but has an old-school look and feel with classic Quake gameplay.

"Arcane Dimensions" is a map collection and partial-conversion mod from Simon O'Callaghan ("sock") and several more of the Quake community's current mappers and coders. Check the readme included in the "ad_v1_50final" folder for complete credits. It features large detailed environments along with new monsters and weapons, pushing the envelope of Quake-ish-ness.

**** What's this then?

This package is one way to get going with the "state of the art" in Quake singleplayer. It's meant to be a convenient bundle of useful tools and explanations. The tools included in here are:

- Simple Quake Launcher 2 by "MaxEd", from https://github.com/m-x-d/Simple-Quake-Launcher-2/releases/latest

- The Mark V "Quake engine" (Quake-playing program) by "Baker" and other contributors, from http://quakeone.com/markv/ . The Mark V website has additional info about the engine, more credits info, and links to other stuff you might want to download. Also note that there are several other Quake engines out there; see the "quake_engines.txt" file in the "readmes\other_stuff" folder if you're curious.

- An installer to help set up the Quake game data files and soundtrack, and some of the many custom singleplayer addons for Quake. The installer can also help launch and play those addons once they are installed.

You might want to keep an eye out in the future for a newer release of Mark V. You can just drop new Mark V files in here and replace the older versions.


**** Version info

The included version of Mark V is 1.99 from May 2018.

As for this whole package of stuff, it's version 1.9. If you want to see what has changed since the previous releases, see "CHANGELOG.txt".

If you've been using a previous version of this package, you can overwrite those files with the ones from this new release; that won't hurt whatever Quake configuration you've set up. Do check the changelog though to see if there's anything in particular you need to know about changes between this and previous versions.


*** How to use this

If you already have a Quake installation, you can drop these files and folders into your existing Quake folder if you like.

You can also just use this package as a new Quake installation starting from scratch.

Things to do:

- If you're starting a new Quake installation from scratch here, you need to move or copy your "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak" files (Quake game data) into the "id1" folder. If you already have another Quake installation on your computer somewhere, you can try running the "installer" batch file and choosing the first menu option; this can usually automatically find and copy those pak files for you.

- Quit out of the installer for now, and try running mark_v.exe. This Quake engine requires the DirectX 9 runtime. If you play other games on this system then you may already have this installed. If however Mark V fails to start, see the "1_setup.txt" file in the "readmes\basic" folder for a link to get the necessary DirectX stuff.

- While you have Mark V running, get your desired Quake configuration set up. The menus are sufficient for normal setup, but you can later get more "hands-on" and manually modify config files if you like. These readme files will provide more details about that if you want them.

- Quit out of Quake and run the "installer" batch file again. You can pick the second option to install the Quake soundtrack.

- Explore the other options in the installer menu to install and play some user-created addons.

- Alternately you can use "SQLauncher2.exe", the Simple Quake Launcher 2, as another great way to manage launching Quake to play custom addons or official missionpacks or the original campaign. Note that Simple Quake Launcher 2 does require Microsoft .Net Framework version 4.5 or later. If you are on Windows 8 or 10, you are probably fine. For more details, especially if you are on Windows 7 or Vista, see the "1_setup.txt" file in the "readmes\basic" folder.


If you're a Quake veteran that's probably all you need to know.

If those steps aren't clear, or if you just want more details, have a look at the files in the "readmes\basic" folder for explanations.

When you want even more things to play, check out the files in the "readmes\maps_and_mods" folder.

The tools included in this package are for Windows users, but much of the info will also apply to playing Quake on macOS or Linux. See the "readmes\other_stuff\not_windows.txt" file for some specific pointers.

The other files in the "readmes\other_stuff" folder are a little more specialized and you might not need to bother with them. You'll see that they're referenced from other readmes in a few spots, or you can just have a look at them if you're curious.

Have fun!

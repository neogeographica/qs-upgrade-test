If you would rather play Quake on macOS or some Linux distro, you can do that! The same Quake pak files and custom content will work on any OS.

Quakespasm-Spiked does have macOS and Linux builds available at https://fte.triptohell.info/moodles/qss/ although they may not be as up-to-date as the Windows versions. If you're good at building stuff from source, you can check out the repo at https://github.com/Shpoike/Quakespasm .

You may also want to investigate other Quake engines as described in "quake_engines.txt".

You can get soundtrack music files from this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=119489135

The "quakestarter_docs\maps_and_mods\4_explore_more.txt" file describes ways to get custom content; it also describes a crossplatform addons downloader/installer/launcher (Quake Injector).

The "no_launcher.txt" file describes how to run custom Quake content if you don't use a launcher.

Finally, if you're playing on Linux and consider yourself pretty familiar with the system and handy with the command line, you may be interested with the Linux desktop integration and Chrome integration for Quake activities here: https://github.com/neogeographica/singleplayer_scripts

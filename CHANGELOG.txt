**** v1.5 (Aug 2017)

- Moved a lot of autoexec.cfg commentary into a separate file autoexec-cfg-example-annotated.txt, because of traditional engine limits on cfg file sizes.

- Tweaks to some messages that the installer prints and to readme file content.

- Fixed bug where installer would not look across multiple disk drives for pak files.

- Fixed issue of a dialog window sometimes popping up during installer run if a CD drive had been recently used but is now empty.


**** v1.4 (Feb 2017)

- Fixed issues in the pak-finder script affecting multi-disk systems and older Steam installs.


**** v1.3 (Feb 2017)

- Unified the batch files under an "uber-installer" so you only need to run one script.

- Did an editing/tweaking pass through the readmes.


**** v1.2 (Jan 2017)

- Fixed files in the release zip to have Windows-style line endings again.

- Added install_pakfiles.bat installer to find pak files on the local computer and copy them.


**** v1.1 (Jan 2017)

- Included build 1036 of the Mark V engines. This also includes the new DirectX 9 variant.

- Moved autoexec.cfg to autoexec.cfg.example. Don't want to stomp on any existing autoexec.cfg file when this package is unzipped. This also required a few changes to the basic/3_configuration.txt readme.

- Removed the included config.cfg. Moved the sv_aim setting to autoexec.cfg.example.

- Added more discussion of config files/settings in autoexec.cfg.example, and a few other additions and corrections to comments about specific settings.

- Added example setting for water warp effect strength.

- Changed a couple of installer batch files (install_modern_episodes.bat and install_other_picks.bat) to print messages about required basegames.

- Added a comment about DX9 runtime requirement (for DX9 engine variant) in the basic/1_setup.txt readme.

- Changed the basic/2_running.txt readme to mention autosaves and the DX9 engine variant.

- Changed the maps_and_mods/3_explore_more.txt readme to describe how to make Quake Injector and Mark V share the same downloaded-zipfiles folder.

- Changed the other_stuff/no_launcher.txt readme to add discussion of quake.rc.

- Added mention of the Linux Mark V build to the other_stuff/not_windows.txt readme.

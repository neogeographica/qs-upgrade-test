**** Launching without a launcher

If you don't have or want to use a launcher, the main things you'll need to know are the name of the game (mod) folder that you want to activate (if any), the name of the map you want to play, and whether the map/mod requires a base game like Quoth or a missionpack. The maps_and_mods docs describe how to find out if there is a base game requirement.

When you know those things, you can handle all launcher-type activities from within the Quake menus and console, in most Quake engines.

You can always fall back to using command-line options, but I won't get into that here. You can get some info about command-line options from the section "The Command Line" in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120426294 and also some of this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166554615


**** The Quake console

To open the Quake console, use the key under the ESC key on your keyboard (for typical US keyboards this is the backtick/tilde key). You can close the Quake console by hitting that key again or by hitting ESC. While the console is open you can type commands to cause stuff to happen, or type in new values for various settings.

This readme will just mention a few console commands. If you're curious to learn more, much of this guide is relevant: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120426294


**** Setting the Base Game and Mod

If the map you want to run is just a .bsp file in the "id1\maps" folder, skip this section. That's the normal/default map location and doesn't involve any mod code.

Otherwise though, you'll need to specify the mod folder to activate. The map/mod may also have a base game requirement (as specified in its readme).

You specify these things using the "game" command in the Quake console.

If the folder containing the addon content is named "foo" and doesn't require a special base game, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo

If the folder is named "foo" and requires Quoth as a base game, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -quoth

If the folder is named "foo" and requires missionpack 1 as a base game, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -hipnotic

If the folder is named "foo" and requires missionpack 2 as a base game, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -rogue

(If you're using a Quakespasm-variant engine, that's all there is to it. Otherwise see the section about quake.rc at the end of this doc.)


**** Setting difficulty

If you know that you almost always want to play at the same difficulty, you should add a line with a "skill" setting to your "id1\autoexec.cfg" file. The legal values for skill are from 0 to 3, which corresponds to difficulty levels Easy to Nightmare. For example if you pretty much always want to play Nightmare difficulty you could add a line to your autoexec.cfg that says:
    skill 3

(Note that if you do use a launcher, the skill setting from the launcher will override this.)

If you don't have this setting in your autoexec.cfg, or if you do but you want to make an exception this time and play at a different difficulty level, then you can use the Quake console to choose the difficulty. Just enter a skill setting in the console AFTER switching the game setting as above (if necessary) and before starting a map.


**** Launching a map

Some Quake engines provide an in-game menu that you can use to choose the map. However any Quake engine will also let you select a map using the console. You'll need to know the map filename. If for example the filename of the map you want to play is "whatsit.bsp", you would use the console command:
    map whatsit


**** What's this about "quake.rc" then?

Here we get into more esoteric stuff that you won't need to know about if using a reasonably recent version of Quakespasm or a variant (like Quakespasm-Spiked and vkQuake).

"quake.rc" is sort of a master config file included among the original Quake gamedata. It executes some other config files, including "autoexec.cfg" if that exists, and also can start playing the attract-mode demos.

The files in a mod release may contain a new different "quake.rc" that sets some console values, creates new console commands, or does other things. Or the mod might not have a new "quake.rc", but it might have new versions of the OTHER config scripts that get executed when you execute "quake.rc".

(If you want a lot more discussion about "quake.rc", see https://tomeofpreach.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/quake-rc-and-being-a-good-citizen/ )

When you start up Quake, it will execute "quake.rc". This includes the case of starting up Quake with the "-game" command-line argument to make it immediately switch to a particular mod folder. So in original Quake (before the "game" console command was added) mods were created under the expectation that "quake.rc" would be run when a mod was activated. Some mods rely on this behavior. Quakestarter also will in some cases put "quake.rc" files into mod folders, customized to help apply mod-recommended settings in a way that does not override anything you might have in your "id1\autoexec.cfg".

So executing "quake.rc" when you activate a mod folder is generally good. Quakespasm-ish engines will indeed execute "quake.rc" when you switch to a mod folder using the "game" console command. For various reasons though, some other engines (such as Mark V) will not. You can see in the console whether this "exec quake.rc" command is being done automatically when the mod folder is activated.

If your Quake engine doesn't execute "quake.rc" for you, you can do it yourself by just entering "exec quake.rc" in the console.

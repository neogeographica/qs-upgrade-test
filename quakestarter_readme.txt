**** What's this then?

This package is one way to get going with the "state of the art" in Quake singleplayer. It's meant to be a convenient bundle of useful tools and explanations. The tools included in here are:

- The "quakestarter.cmd" script. This provides a menu-driven experience to help set up the Quake game data files and soundtrack, and to help install/play/manage some of the many custom singleplayer addons for Quake. (If you don't show file extensions then it will just look like "quakestarter".) We'll refer to this script as Quakestarter throughout these docs.

- Simple Quake Launcher 2 by "MaxEd", from https://github.com/m-x-d/Simple-Quake-Launcher-2/releases/latest . This is a front-end for running Quake which can be helpful when you explore beyond the set of addons that Quakestarter supports.

- The Quakespasm-Spiked "Quake engine" (Quake-playing program) from https://fte.triptohell.info/moodles/qss/ . Quakespasm-Spiked or "QSS" is an elaboration by "Spike" and other contributors on the original Quakespasm from http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/ . Note that there are several other Quake engines out there; see the "quake_engines.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\other_stuff" folder if you're curious.

You might want to keep an eye out in the future for newer releases of Quakespasm-Spiked. You can just drop new Quakespasm-Spiked files in here and replace the older versions.

*** How to use this

You can use this package as a new Quake installation starting from scratch.

Or if you already have a Quake installation, you can drop these files and folders into that existing Quake folder if you like. The "1_setup.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\basic" folder goes into a bit more detail about that approach.

Things to do:

- You're going to need Microsoft .Net Framework version 4.5 or later. If you are on Windows 8 or 10, you are probably fine. For more details, especially if you are on Windows 7 or Vista, see the "1_setup.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\basic" folder.

- If you're starting a new Quake installation from scratch, you need to move or copy your "pak0.pak" and "pak1.pak" files (Quake game data) into the "id1" folder. If you already have another Quake installation on your computer somewhere, you can run Quakestarter and choose the first menu option; this can usually automatically find and copy those pak files for you.

- You can also use the second option in the main Quakestarter menu to get the Quake soundtrack files set up.

- Now use the third option in the main menu to launch Quake. Hopefully it works! This would be a good time to get your desired Quake configuration set up. The Quake in-game menus are sufficient for normal setup, but you can later get more "hands-on" and manually modify config files if you like. These docs will provide more details about that if you want them.

- Quit out of Quake and return to the Quakestarter menu. At this point you should be able to freely explore the remaining menu options and try any addon that looks interesting. (If you want more info about an addon, you can look up its page on https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/ )

- Alternately you can use "SQLauncher2.exe", the Simple Quake Launcher 2, as another great way to manage launching Quake to play custom addons or official missionpacks or the original campaign.


If you're a Quake veteran that's probably all you need to know.

If those steps aren't clear, or if you just want more details, have a look at the docs in the "quakestarter_docs\basic" folder for explanations.

When you want even more things to play, and more details about how to play maps/mods outside of Quakestarter, check out the docs in the "quakestarter_docs\maps_and_mods" folder.

The tools included in this package are for Windows users, but much of the info will also apply to playing Quake on macOS or Linux. See the "not_windows.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\other_stuff" folder for some specific pointers.

The other docs in the "quakestarter_docs\other_stuff" folder are a little more specialized and you might not need to bother with them. You'll see that they're referenced from other docs in a few spots, or you can just have a look at them if you're curious.

Have fun!

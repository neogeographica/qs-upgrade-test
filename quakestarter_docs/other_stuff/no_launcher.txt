**** Launching without a launcher

If you don't have or want to use a launcher, the main things you'll need to know are the name of the game (mod) folder that you want to activate (if any), the name of the map you want to play, and whether the map/mod requires Quoth or a missionpack. The "3_running_with_sql2.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\maps_and_mods" folder goes into more detail about how to interpret what a readme says about such dependencies.

When you know those things, you can handle all launcher-type activities from within the Quake menus and console, in most Quake engines.

You can always fall back to using command-line options, but I won't get into that here. You can get some info about command-line options from the section "The Command Line" in this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120426294 and also some of this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=166554615


**** The Quake console

To open the Quake console, use the key under the ESC key on your keyboard (for typical US keyboards this is the backtick/tilde key). You can close the Quake console by hitting that key again or by hitting ESC. While the console is open you can type commands to cause stuff to happen, or type in new values for various settings.

This readme will just mention a few console commands. If you're curious to learn more, much of this guide is relevant: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=120426294


**** Setting the mod folder(s) and/or missionpack

If the map you want to run is just a .bsp file in the "id1\maps" folder, skip this section. That's the normal/default map location and doesn't involve any mod code.

Otherwise though, you'll need to specify the mod folder(s) to activate. The map/mod may also have a dependency on Quoth or an official missionpack.

You specify these things using the "game" command in the Quake console.

If the folder containing the addon content is named "foo" and doesn't depend on any special game content, then you would just activate it with this command:
    game foo

If the folder is named "foo" and requires Quoth, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -quoth

If the folder is named "foo" and requires missionpack 1, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -hipnotic

If the folder is named "foo" and requires missionpack 2, then you would activate it with this command:
    game foo -rogue

If the folder depends on another non-Quoth non-missionpack mod folder, as describe in the "3_running_with_sql2.txt" doc in the "quakestarter_docs\maps_and_mods" folder, you can add that dependency as the first argument. For example to run "udob_v1_1" that depends on "copper_v1_11", you would use the command:
    game copper_v1_11 udob_v1_1

If you get an error from that last form of the command, then your Quake engine does not support activating multiple mod folders.

Once you've executed the "game" command, if you see the message "execing quake.rc" appear in the console, you're ready to play. (This should be the case with any recent Quakespasm-variant engine.) Otherwise see the "quake_rc.txt" doc for some more necessary details.


**** Setting difficulty

If you know that you almost always want to play at the same difficulty, you should add a line with a "skill" setting to your "id1\autoexec.cfg" file. The legal values for skill are from 0 to 3, which corresponds to difficulty levels Easy to Nightmare. For example if you pretty much always want to play Nightmare difficulty you could add a line to your autoexec.cfg that says:
    skill 3

(Note that if you do use a launcher, the skill setting from the launcher will override this.)

If you don't have this setting in your autoexec.cfg, or if you do but you want to make an exception this time and play at a different difficulty level, then you can use the Quake console to choose the difficulty. Just enter a skill setting in the console AFTER switching the game setting as above (if necessary) and before starting a map.


**** Launching a map

Some Quake engines provide an in-game menu that you can use to choose the map. However any Quake engine will also let you select a map using the console. You'll need to know the map filename. If for example the filename of the map you want to play is "whatsit.bsp", you would use the console command:
    map whatsit

In most Quake engines you can use autocomplete to see what maps are available. Just type "map" followed by a space and then press the Tab key. You can also use the autocomplete feature to avoid having to type the entire name of the map.

**** Installer batch files

This package includes some batch files in the "installers" directory, to make it as easy as possible to download and install a sampler of good user-created Quake content. These installers will also apply any essential patches to a downloaded mod, and sometimes make other fixes to a mod so that it can use mod-recommended settings without nuking settings that you have in your own "autoexec.cfg" file.

Note that these installers make use of Mark V. So if you are not on Windows or don't have Mark V available, they won't work. They also require the quaddicted.com website to be up, since that's where the files come from.

The installer batch files are:

* install_2016_episodes - Covers installing "Dimension of the Past" and/or "Arcane Dimensions".

* install_modern_episodes - Covers highly-rated episodes released after "Nehahra".

* install_classic_episodes - Covers highly-rated episodes up through "Nehahra".

* install_other_picks - Other highly-rated content not covered by the other installers.

This is NOT all the worthwhile Quake singleplayer content, not by a long shot. Even many of my personal favorites are not covered by these installers. If you enjoy Quake SP I really recommend checking out other things at quaddicted.com, as described in the "3_explore_more.txt" file.

A few of these mods do require using special "Base Game" settings in the Simple Quake Launcher. Specifically:

- apsp3 and warpspasm each require using the "Quoth" base game. (Installing through these batch files will also install Quoth if necessary.)

- chapters requires specifying the "EP1: Scourge of Armagon" base game. This is true even if you do not have that missionpack installed!

- nehahra requires using the "Nehahra" base game (and also "nehahra" as the game setting).


**** Installer issues

Mark V (at least up through the December 2016 build) will incorrectly install a few of the maps/mods covered by these batch files: "arcanum", "apsp3", "func_mapjam2", and "mapjam6".

The installer batch file will detect that problem, and it will automatically correct it if you have .Net 4.5 installed to enable some unzip operations. (If you are on Windows 8 or 10 then you do have .Net 4.5 already.)

If the batch file can't automatically correct the problem, it will tell you where the downloaded zipfile is so that you can extract the mod manually if you like.


**** Uninstalling

Any Quake mod can be uninstalled by just deleting its folder.

For content downloaded through Mark V, its original zipfile is also saved inside the "id1\_library" folder. You can delete that zipfile if you don't think you'll want it again any time soon.

For convenience there's an "uninstall" console command in Mark V. You could for example do:
    uninstall travail
to remove the "travail" game folder and its contents, or you could do:
    uninstall travail full
to remove both that game folder and also the downloaded "id1\_library\travail.zip" file.

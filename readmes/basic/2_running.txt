**** Before you run any addons

It's good to run mark_v.exe at least once before playing any custom content, and set up your desired configuration. Any settings that you configure in the default Quake game will be used as a starting point when you later launch custom content.


**** Running addons through the installer

The "installer" batch file not only provides options for installing/uninstalling selected addons, but it also is an easy way to launch Quake.

After you have installed an item, or if you select an already-installed item, the installer will give you the option to play or uninstall it. The choices for playing look like this:

  y: launch without explicitly setting a skill
  n: do not launch
  0-3: launch and set a default initial skill

If you choose "y" or just press Enter, the addon will be launched using a default skill value. Usually the default skill is 1 ("Normal"), but you may want to set up a different default skill for yourself as described in the "readmes\other_stuff\no_launcher.txt" file. Then you can always just hammer the Enter key to quickly launch stuff without needing to specifically enter a skill value. (If the addon comes with its own "start" map, it may also provide a way to select the skill value in-game.)

If the addon is a multi-map collection that doesn't have its own startmap, you will need to select the map you want to play after Quake has launched. Mark V's "Single Player" menu includes a "Levels" menu you can use to do this.

Using the installer is the easiest way to correctly launch one of these addons, but it has limitations:

- It can only launch the same addons that it knows how to install. Once you branch out into playing other stuff, you'll need to use Simple Quake Launcher 2 or other methods.

- It will always run mark_v.exe as the Quake engine. If you would rather it use a different Quake engine, that's possible if you are familiar with editing batch files or setting Windows environment variables, but you might just want to use Simple Quake Launcher 2 instead.

(If you do want to mess around with how the installer chooses the Quake engine to run, see the installers\_mod_launch.cmd file and how it uses the quake_exe variable.)


**** Using the launcher

The Simple Quake Launcher 2 is another great way to start up Quake. It's not quite as easy as the installer, but it's more powerful.

When you run "SQLauncher2.exe", you'll get a dialog window with a few settings to choose.

The first thing to choose is the "Engine":
- Pick "mark_v" if you want a GLQuake look.
- Pick "mark_v_winquake" if you want a more original-Quake-ish WinQuake look, instead of a GLQuake look.

(Note that the winquake version can't properly render a few modern Quake map elements, like partially transparent fence or vine textures. However it takes a pretty good shot at playing modern content with the original presentation.)

Don't worry about the "Resolution" setting; you can pick your video settings in the Mark V in-game menus.

Leave the "Game" set to "Quake" for now.

For "Mod", choose "[Default]" if you want to play the original Quake campaign. If you have other content installed, there will be additional choices available for "Mod". E.g. you could choose "dopa" for "Dimension of the Past", or "ad_v1_70final" for "Arcane Dimensions", if you have those installed.

When you've picked what you want to play, click the big "Launch" button at the bottom, and away you go!

The launcher has other options that allow you to jump directly into individual maps using a specified skill (difficulty) setting. You don't need to worry about that if you're starting the Quake campaign from the beginning, since that campaign allows skill selection inside the startmap. The official missionpacks and some custom episodes also have startmaps with in-game skill selection.

(But it never hurts to specify your desired skill when launching custom content, just in case.)

If you have an official missionpack installed and want to play that, you would choose that missionpack as the "Game" and choose "[Default]" for the "Mod".

There may also be other occasions when you will need to choose special base game settings when playing custom content, as described in the maps_and_mods readmes.


**** Mark V autosaves

The Mark V engine has several cool usability features, but maybe the most important one to mention here is autosaves. Next time you die in a nightmare-skill run through some hardcore map, don't get frustrated if you forgot to save your game; instead just load up an autosave.

Some key things about Mark V autosaves:
- Autosaving starts 2 minutes after a map begins, then saves again every 1.5 minutes.
- There are three rotating autosave files: auto_save_0, auto_save_1, and auto_save_2. auto_save_0 is the most recent.
- Autosaves do NOT show up in the normal load-game menu.
- You can load an autosave easily by opening the Quake console, typing "load a", and hitting Tab to autocomplete the command to "load auto_save_0". You can keep hitting Tab if you need to cycle to some earlier autosave. Then hit Enter to load the selected autosave.
- You also might want to bind a key to load an autosave. For example this console command would make the P key load the most recent autosave: bind p "load auto_save_0"


**** If Mark V isn't working for you...

See the "readmes\other_stuff\quake_engines.txt" file to learn about other programs that can play Quake.

Note that if the installer batch files are working for you, you may want to leave "mark_v.exe" in place even if you end up using some other Quake engine to actually play. The installer batch files make use of Mark V to perform downloads.

**** What is that?

A program that plays Quake is often called a "Quake engine" or a "source port". Community members have been working on such things since soon after the original Quake source code was released back in the 90s.

The following Steam guide has an overview of some of the most-used current engines, although I've let it get outdated in some parts: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118401000

Different Quake engines have different goals. Some are focussed on singleplayer, some on multiplayer; some are mostly about fixing bugs or adding "quality of life" features, while others are about supporting new visual effects; etc.


**** Why Mark V?

For this little package I've chosen to include only the Mark V engine, from http://quakeone.com/markv/

For singleplayer, Mark V is in a good spot on the spectrum of authenticity, compatibility, and usability. Its native support for downloading and installing mods also comes in handy.

Note that while it's been tested well, Mark V is still relatively new. If you run across any problems using Mark V for playing singleplayer content, I would recommend Quakespasm as an alternative (http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/download.htm).

Quakespasm has long been the go-to Quake engine for singleplayer content, and I didn't include it in this package mainly because its defaults and menu options aren't quite as friendly as those in Mark V. For running Quakespasm on Windows, I recommend getting the latest 64-bit download for Quakespasm and then using "quakespasm.exe" as the Quake engine; you can run it using Simple Quake Launcher 2 or any other launcher just like you do with Mark V.

Quakestarter is a package with tools for setting up a playable Quake installation and downloading/playing/managing many highly-regarded addons. This includes any necessary patching and recommended configurations for the addons! This package also contains quite a bit of documentation on configuring Quake and exploring other user-created content.

New players can use Quakestarter as a quick and easy way to get going with Quake and the many amazing things created for it since 1996.

Veteran players can use it as a nice way to bootstrap "yet another Quake installation", or to discover overlooked gems -- since no one can keep up with every single piece of custom content released.

See the quakestarter_readme.txt file for details!

--------------------

A "release" of the Quakestarter package is created by running the "devtools/release.py" script, which zips up most of the files in this repo along with the latest stable releases of Quakespasm-Spiked and Simple Quake Launcher 2.

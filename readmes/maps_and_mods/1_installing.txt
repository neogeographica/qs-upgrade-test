**** Installer

This package includes an "installer" batch file to make it as easy as possible to download and install a sampler of good user-created Quake content. This process will also apply any essential patches to a downloaded mod, and sometimes make other fixes to a mod so that it can use mod-recommended settings without nuking settings that you have in your own "autoexec.cfg" file.

Note that this install process makes use of Mark V ("mark_v.exe"). So if you are not on Windows or don't have Mark V available, it won't work. It also requires the quaddicted.com website to be up, since that's where the files come from.

The installer choices are:

* Episodes released in 2016 - Covers installing "Dimension of the Past" and/or "Arcane Dimensions".

* "Modern" episodes from pre-2016 - Covers highly-rated episodes released after "Nehahra".

* Classic episodes - Covers highly-rated episodes up through "Nehahra".

* Other highly-rated maps up thru 2016 - Other highly-rated content not covered by the other choices above.

This is NOT all the worthwhile Quake singleplayer content, not by a long shot. Even many of my personal favorites are not covered by these choices. If you enjoy Quake SP I really recommend checking out other things at quaddicted.com, as described in the "3_explore_more.txt" file.

A few of these mods do require using special "Game" settings in the Simple Quake Launcher. Specifically:

- apsp3 and warpspasm each require specifying "Quoth" as the "Game". (Installing these using the "installer" batch file will also get Quoth for you if necessary.)

- chapters requires specifying "MP1: Scourge of Armagon" as the "Game". This is true even if you do not have that missionpack currently installed!

- nehahra requires specifying "Nehahra" as the "Game".


**** Installer issues

Mark V (at least up through the January 2017 build) will incorrectly install a few of the maps/mods covered by this installer: "arcanum", "apsp3", "func_mapjam2", and "mapjam6".

The installer script will detect that problem, and it will automatically correct it if you have .Net 4.5 installed to enable some unzip operations. (If you are on Windows 8 or 10 then you do have .Net 4.5 already.)

If the installer can't automatically correct the problem, it will tell you where the downloaded zipfile is so that you can extract the mod manually if you like.


**** Uninstalling

Any Quake mod can be uninstalled by just deleting its folder.

For content downloaded through Mark V, its original zipfile is also saved inside the "id1\_library" folder. You can delete that zipfile if you don't think you'll want it again any time soon.

For convenience there's an "uninstall" console command in Mark V. You could for example do:
    uninstall travail
to remove the "travail" game folder and its contents, or you could do:
    uninstall travail full
to remove both that game folder and also the downloaded "id1\_library\travail.zip" file.

**** Quake Injector

Quake Injector (https://www.quaddicted.com/tools/quake_injector) is worth a look when you're ready to really dig into Quake addons. It has a bit of a learning curve, but it runs on any OS (as a Java app) and it understands how to install and launch every bit of content from Quaddicted.

Note that both Quake Injector and also the Mark V install feature (see below) like to keep around the zipfiles that they download, even if you uninstall a mod, until you explicitly delete the zipfile. If you're going to be using both of these downloaders then you probably want to configure Quake Injector to use the same directory as Mark V for storing downloaded zipfiles. To do this:

* Open the "Engine Configuration" dialog in Quake Injector.

* Set the "Download Directory" to point to the "id1\_library" folder in your Quake installation. If you haven't installed anything using Mark V yet, that folder won't exist yet; in that case, you can use the file selector to choose the "id1" folder, and then finish typing the "\_library" part of the path yourself.

* Click "OK" to close the dialog and apply the settings.

One thing to look out for though is that the Mark V install feature (and therefore these batch scripts that use it) doesn't work exactly the same as Quake Injector when it comes to choosing the name for a mod folder. For example Mark V will install Arcane Dimensions 1.7 in the "ad_v1_70final" folder, while Quake Injector will store it in the "ad" folder. So to avoid confusion and wasted disk space on duplicate stuff, it's best to settle on using only one of these install methods.


**** DIY

Once you're familiar with how Quake maps and mods work, it's not rocket science to install them yourself. The main things to be aware of are:

The best place to find singleplayer Quake content is at https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/

You can also watch for new releases at http://www.celephais.net/board/forum.php

When you download an addon, it sometimes consists of a bunch of files that are meant to be placed inside a new game folder in your Quake installation. If this is the case then there should be a readme file included that tells you this. (Usually it's obvious anyway.)

If it is just a map that doesn't change anything else about Quake gameplay, it can instead be placed into your "id1\maps" folder (which you can create if necessary). This is the case if the addon just consists of a .bsp file and maybe an associated .txt file.

**** Mark V install

The Mark V Quake engine supports an "install" command in the Quake console that will automatically download and install zipfiles that contain maps/mods, either from Quaddicted or from a complete web URL that you supply.

For example you could do
    install travail
to install the "travail" mod from Quaddicted. Or if you wanted to install a mod from some other source, you could do something like
    install http://some.other.weberver/some_mod.zip

Quake mods can be packaged in lots of quirky ways. Mark V tries to figure out how best to unpack the downloaded archive, and whether or not its contents should be placed under id1 or in its own mod directory. You can give it some guidance; let's say for example that you want to make sure that the "terra" mapset will be installed in its own "terra" directory. You could do that with the console command
    install terra self
or you could even force it to be installed in a mod directory named "cheese" with the console command
    install terra cheese

Since Mark V tries to figure out how to install a mod just by examining the zipfile contents, it's possible that it could make mistakes (although it works correctly for all of the maps/mods covered here). Mark V also won't know to apply any patches that were later released for the mod. But it's the quickest & easiest way to install a mod if you know the mod's identifier and you are already running Mark V.
